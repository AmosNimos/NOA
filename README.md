**NOA Manifesto**

**Neutral, Objective, Apolitical (NOA)**

The NOA tag represents a commitment to preserving the integrity of software development by keeping projects free of political, cultural, or personal biases. Similar to the FOSS tag, NOA establishes principles for creating and maintaining projects that focus purely on technical excellence, transparency, and inclusivity in the truest sense, free from any form of ideological influence. This manifesto outlines the core values and expectations of NOA-tagged projects.


### Why "Manifesto"?  

While "manifesto" is often tied to politics, it simply means a declaration of principles. The irony isn’t lost on us, but the choice was intentional to signal a clear, bold commitment to neutrality and technical excellence.  

This project isn’t about creating a bias-free world—that’s unrealistic. Instead, it’s a call to critically challenge biases in software. Like the Pythagorean theorem, great tools can be apolitical, keeping both the tools and their creators separate from ideological meddling.

### Personal Beliefs Are Irrelevant

What contributors believe or do in their free time is their own business. NOA projects are committed to judging contributions solely on their technical merit. As long as someone’s actions outside the project aren’t criminal and their work meets the project’s standards, their beliefs, whether about politics, aliens, or Earth shape related, are irrelevant.
The focus is on the code, not the contributor. Leave personal ideologies at the door, and let’s build something great together.

### The NOA Tag: A Personal Commitment

The NOA tag isn’t a policing mechanism—it’s a pledge. By adopting it, a project commits to these principles as a guide, striving to embody them to the best of its ability. There’s no enforcement body, just transparency and accountability.

The goal is to put systems in place that make adherence to NOA values visible and measurable. This transparency empowers users and contributors to see if a project truly prioritizes technical improvement, neutrality, and dedication to its stated purpose.

It’s not about perfection but about creating a way to identify and support projects that aim to innovate without distractions, staying focused on the work they advocate for.

### **Core Principles of NOA**

1. **Neutrality**
   - Projects must remain apolitical, avoiding involvement or alignment with any political ideologies, cultural movements, or personal beliefs.
   - Contributions to the project are judged solely on their technical merit, not the identity, beliefs, or affiliations of the contributor.

2. **Objectivity**
   - Development decisions must be guided by logic, technical needs, and practical considerations, ensuring unbiased and well-reasoned outcomes.
   - Features and updates should prioritize user functionality, efficiency, and innovation without pandering to external agendas.

3. **Transparency**
   - All funding sources must be disclosed publicly, including the amount and any associated conditions or restrictions.
   - Financial transparency ensures no covert influence compromises the NOA principles. Big corporate funding is discouraged to prevent external pressures that could dilute or manipulate the project’s direction.

4. **Apolitical Stance**
   - The project’s focus remains strictly on software development and technical progress. Social, cultural, or ideological narratives have no place in the project’s goals or communication.
   - Respect for contributors’ diverse backgrounds and beliefs is ensured by maintaining an environment where personal ideologies are irrelevant to the project.

5. **Non-Corporate Influence**
   - NOA projects reject funding, sponsorship, or partnerships that could compromise their independence. Financial contributions must be free of conditions that conflict with NOA values.
   - The goal is to avoid the "embrace, extend, and extinguish" tactics often used by corporations to dominate and undermine independent projects.

### **Funding**  

For a project to qualify as NOA-tagged, its funding must be transparent and fully allocated to the project's core objectives. Donations, grants, or other forms of financial support intended for the project must not be diverted to unrelated ventures.  

- **Core Focus of Funds**  
   Money raised for the project must directly contribute to its improvement, such as:  
   - Enhancing core features.  
   - Resolving bugs and technical issues.  
   - Advancing innovation directly tied to the project’s goals.  

- **No Unrelated Spending**  
   Funds must not be used for external initiatives, ideological pursuits, or ventures unrelated to the specific project for which the money was donated. Examples of misallocation include:  
   - A browser project funding conferences or studies unrelated to web development.  
   - An operating system allocating resources to social initiatives instead of improving the OS.  
   - A kernel project investing in startups outside of kernel or system-level advancements.  

- **Transparency and Accountability**  
   All financial transactions must be publicly disclosed, detailing:  
   - The sources of funding and their amounts.  
   - Clear descriptions of how funds were spent, ensuring alignment with the project's core mission.  

- **Separate Ventures, Separate Funding**  
   If the team wishes to pursue other projects or ventures, those must be funded independently. Mixing funds or using resources meant for one project to support another undermines trust and violates NOA principles.  

By adhering to these principles, NOA projects ensure that every dollar serves its intended purpose—advancing the core project for which it was entrusted.  

### **Commitments of NOA-Tagged Projects**

- **Focus on Technical Excellence:** Development efforts remain centered on creating efficient, reliable, and innovative software solutions.
- **Non-Discrimination:** Every aspect of the project,from code contributions to user accessibility,is free from discrimination in any form, regardless of political, social, or ideological background. This includes rejecting xenophobic, racist, or any other discriminatory behavior from any side.
- **Rejection of "Woke" or "Religious" Bias:** Projects are shielded from trends or movements that attempt to force ideological or religious compliance at the expense of technical quality or project focus. This applies equally to both left-wing and right-wing biases,no exceptions.
- **Sustainability Through Transparency:** Financial and operational details are open for public scrutiny, ensuring accountability and trustworthiness.
- **Respect for Personal Beliefs:** Contributors will not be banned for their personal views outside of the project. You are free to believe and express whatever you wish in your personal life or on your own social media, as long as you don't bring it into the project. Think of it as the “don’t bring your drama to work” principle,let’s keep the focus on the project and the work at hand.

### **Preventing Corruption of NOA Values**

1. **Community Governance**
   - Decision-making processes should involve the community to avoid centralization of power that could be manipulated.
   - Clear guidelines and policies must be in place to ensure adherence to NOA principles.

2. **Strict Financial Guidelines**
   - Donations and funding must be publicly documented, with full transparency about terms and conditions.
   - Any attempt to impose restrictions that conflict with NOA principles must be rejected.

3. **Independent Audits**
   - Regular audits of finances and decision-making processes can help ensure continued compliance with NOA values.

4. **Resilience Against External Pressure**
   - Develop strategies to resist corporate or ideological pressure, such as relying on distributed and community-based funding sources.
   - Use decentralized communication platforms to avoid external censorship or influence.

### **The Path Forward**

NOA is more than a tag; it’s a movement to restore focus, integrity, and neutrality to software development. By adopting the NOA tag, projects declare their commitment to technical excellence, transparency, and independence, free from ideological or corporate corruption. Together, we can create software that serves everyone equally, driven by innovation and purpose, not agendas.

Code Quality > Politics
I don’t think that’s so convoluted.
